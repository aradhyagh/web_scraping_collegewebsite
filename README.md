# web_scraping_books


This project is designed to demonstrate web scraping techniques using Python and popular libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests. The goal of the project is to scrape data from [the target website](https://collegedunia.com/reviews/page-2), extract relevant information, and store it in a structured format (e.g., CSV ).


## Features
1. Scrape data from a target website
2. Extract specific information
3. Clean and structure the data
4. Export data to a file (CSV)


## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
1. Python 3.x
2. pip (for managing Python packages)


## Libraries
The following Python libraries are required for the project:
1. requests (for making HTTP requests)
2. beautifulsoup4 (for parsing HTML content)
3. pandas (for data manipulation and exporting to CSV, optional)
4. lxml (optional, for faster HTML parsing)


## Notes
Make sure to respect the terms of service of the website you are scraping.
Be cautious of the websiteâ€™s robots.txt to ensure you are allowed to scrape it.
If the website changes its structure, you may need to adjust the scraping logic.
